# Tenor Saxophone Long Tones

This course asks you to play a long tone using the note specified in each exercise. The names of the
notes are given in the format `<NOTE_NAME><OCTAVE_NUMBER>` (e.g., A2, Bb4, etc.). The notes are
transposed to the tenor saxophone and not in concert pitch. This means the note C4, for example,
refers to the note Bb3 in concert pitch.

This course covers the normal range of the tenor saxophone, from the note Bb2 to the note Gb5. It
does not cover the altissimo range.
